# Dyslexia Extension

This extension was originally developed for the New Covenant Christian Academy (NCCA) for students with dyslexia (a condition of neurodevelopmental origin that mainly affects the ease with which a person reads, writes, and spells). This document explains the functionalities, setup, and controls of the extension.

NOTE: THIS EXTENSION IS DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH THE GOOGLE CHROME WEB BROWSER (min. ver. 24.0.1307.0). PLEASE ENSURE YOUR CHROME BROWSER MEETS THE MINIMUM VERSION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE CONTINUING FORWARD.

## Functionalities

This extension was developed to assist students with dyslexia in reading comprehension of web-based files/text. This extension (when toggled on) modifies the webpage in two ways:

    (1) All text on a webpage will be converted to a dyslexia-friendly font style called Lexend (website: fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend).

    (2) All fonts will have a font-size of 12px (Equivalent to 12pt. font) if the existing size before modification is less than such. Otherwise, the font size will remain the same.

## Setup

Please follow the instructions below step by step to properly install the extension.

    (1) This file should be found in a directory with the the following files/directories: manifest.json, LICENSE, >scripts, >Lexend, >css. Move this directory to a safe place on your device where you can easily access it but where it is unlikely to be modified/interacted with on a daily basis. A good location to place this directory would be in a seperate folder in your 'Documents' folder. A bad location would be in your 'Downloads' folder.

    (2) Go to chrome://extensions

    (3) In the top-right of the screen, enable 'Developer Mode'. You must do this to allow for personally-developed extensions to run on your web-browsers.

    (4) In the top-left of the screen, select 'Load Unpacked'. After doing so, you will be prompted to select a folder. Select this folder (dyslexiaExtension).

    (5) After the previous step, you should now see an extension called 'Dyslexia Font Style'. If it is not enabled, do so (ensure the togglable slider found in the extension box is to the right)

    (6) All websites accessed now will have this extension enabled. If you had previous windows open while performing these steps, a refrest is required to load the extension for that webpage instance.

## Controls

The extension is enabled by default for all webpages. To toggle the extension on and off, press the key combo ctrl+backslash (control key and backslash key). When the extension is enabled, all side-effects listed under "Functionalities" will be on.
